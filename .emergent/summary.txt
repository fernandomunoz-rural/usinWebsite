<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to create a modern, user-friendly landing page for a non-profit organization called the Utah Intercollegiate Service Network (UISN). The initial request was for a basic landing page with forms, using specific brand colors from a provided logo.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
Over the course of the conversation, the requirements evolved significantly:
1.  **Full Landing Page:** Create a multi-section landing page including a Hero, About, Programs, Events, Testimonials, Contact, and Footer.
2.  **Content Management System (CMS):** The user needs a simple way to update all website content (stats, programs, events, announcements, stories, etc.) without editing code. This led to the creation of an admin dashboard.
3.  **Admin Authentication:** The CMS must be protected by a login system, accessible only to UISN Council members. The login button should be on the main navigation.
4.  **Database Persistence:** All CMS content and form submissions must be saved to a database, not just in the browser's local storage.
5.  **Program Pages & Custom Forms:** Each of the four main programs must have its own dedicated page with a unique, detailed application form. All form submissions must be sent to the email .
6.  **Specific Content:** The user provided exact text, stats, and details for various sections, including:
    *   **Stats:** 9+ Partner Universities, 1000+ Volunteers, 5000+ Service Hours.
    *   **Story:** Founded in 2026 at Snow College with UServeUtah's help.
    *   **Contact:** Address (Ephraim, UT 84627), Phone (435-263-1140).
    *   **Testimonials:** Two specific testimonials from Sofia Lopez and Kessy Gohin.
7.  **Deployment:** The user wants to deploy the application and has a domain. They have chosen to use Vercel for the frontend and Railway for the backend.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A complete React frontend for the UISN landing page has been built. It includes all requested sections and a client-side CMS that uses  for data management. An admin login system and an integrated admin panel (which appears as a floating overlay when logged in) are functional at the frontend level. The agent has just created the FastAPI backend files () with API endpoints for the CMS and form submissions, along with deployment configuration files (, , ).

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working:** The agent began the critical task of migrating the application from a -based prototype to a full-stack application with a persistent database. It created the FastAPI backend server with all the necessary API endpoints to manage CMS content and handle form submissions. It also generated initial deployment files for Railway.
*   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
*   **Agent Testing Done:** N
*   **Which testing method agent to use?** both
*   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
*   **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, react-router-dom
*   **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, pymongo
*   **Database:** MongoDB
*   **State Management:** Transitioning from  to a backend-driven state.
*   **Deployment:** Vercel (Frontend), Railway (Backend)

**key DB schema**
The schema is defined by Pydantic models in .
*   **Collections:** , , , , , , , , .

**changes in tech stack**
*   The application is in the process of a major architectural change: moving from a frontend-only prototype using  to a full-stack application with a FastAPI backend and a MongoDB database.

**All files of reference**
*   : The new FastAPI backend server containing all API logic.
*   : List of Python dependencies for the backend.
*   : The  utility file that needs to be refactored to use API calls.
*   : Main React component handling routing and the admin panel visibility.
*   : Component with custom forms that needs to be updated to submit data to the backend.
*   : The guide for deploying the application.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
*   The entire data layer on the frontend needs refactoring. All components and utility functions currently interacting with  must be updated to communicate with the new backend API.

**key api endpoints**
*   : Fetches all CMS content.
*   : Submits data from any of the forms.
*   : CRUD operations for all manageable content.
*   : Manages site-wide settings like the 'Donate' button visibility.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
1.  **Top Priority:** Your main task is to complete the migration to a full-stack architecture. This involves fixing the backend dependencies () and then refactoring the frontend to use the new API ().
2.  **Backend is Ready (Code-wise):** The backend code in  is already written. You need to make it runnable and then connect the frontend to it.
3.  **User Credentials Required:** The user wants to use their Gmail for email notifications. You will need to ask them for a Gmail App Password to implement this securely. Do not ask for their main password.
4.  **Deployment Goal:** The end goal is a fully deployed application. Keep the deployment guide () in mind as you complete the backend integration.

1.  **User:** alright i geuss iw oudl eed a dtabas e fro this right so that the chnages are officially saved... - Requested a database and deployment info. (Status: In Progress)
2.  **Agent:** Proposed FastAPI + MongoDB and asked for confirmation. (Status: Addressed)
3.  **User:** yeh go for it use my hmail acount for now an dthen use vercel and railway for backend go - Confirmed the plan. (Status: In Progress)
4.  ... (Agent performed actions to create backend files) ...

**Project Health Check:**
*   **Broken:** The connection between the frontend and the new backend is missing. The application still uses , which is not the desired final state. Forms do not submit to a database or send emails. The backend server is not runnable due to missing dependencies.
*   **Mocked:** All data is currently mocked via  in . This entire system is slated for replacement.

**3rd Party Integrations**
*   **Planned:**
    *   **Gmail API (via SMTP):** For sending emails from forms. Requires User App Password.
    *   **MongoDB Atlas:** Cloud database for data persistence. Requires User API Key/Connection String.
    *   **Vercel:** For frontend deployment. Requires user to connect their GitHub account.
    *   **Railway:** For backend deployment. Requires user to connect their GitHub account.
