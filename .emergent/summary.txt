<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to create a modern, user-friendly landing page for a non-profit organization called the Utah Intercollegiate Service Network (UISN). The project evolved from a simple landing page to a full-stack application with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and a complete Content Management System (CMS) for the user to manage all website content (stats, programs, events, testimonials, etc.). Key requirements include admin authentication, custom forms for program applications, email notifications for submissions, and successful deployment of the application.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Full Landing Page:** A multi-section page including Hero, About, Programs, Events, Testimonials, Contact, and Footer.
2.  **Content Management System (CMS):** An admin dashboard, protected by a login, allowing the user to update all dynamic content without touching the code.
3.  **Database Persistence:** All CMS content and form submissions must be saved to a MongoDB database.
4.  **Custom Program & Event Pages:** Each program and event should have its own dedicated detail page.
5.  **Email Notifications:** All form submissions must trigger an email to .
6.  **Deployment:** Deploy the backend to Railway and the frontend to a free service (Netlify is the current choice).

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend. The backend is successfully deployed on Railway and connected to the user's production MongoDB Atlas database. Email notifications via Gmail SMTP are implemented and working. The frontend is fully integrated with the backend API for all content management and form submissions. However, the frontend deployment to Netlify is failing due to complex Node.js dependency conflicts. The agent has recently fixed the application's local preview, which was broken during attempts to resolve the deployment issues.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was addressing two separate issues simultaneously. The primary focus was on fixing the failing Netlify deployment. Concurrently, the user reported a new bug where the Upcoming Events section is not visible on mobile devices. The agent acknowledged this responsive bug but had not yet started debugging it.
*   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
*   **Agent Testing Done:** N
*   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent (for the mobile view bug) and manual deployment verification on Netlify.
*   **User Testing Done:** N (User is waiting for a successful deployment link and a fix for the mobile bug).

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   **Issue 1:** Finalize and Confirm Successful Frontend Deployment (Priority: P0)
*   **Issue 2:** Upcoming Events Section Not Visible on Mobile View (Priority: P1)

**Issues Detail:**
*   **Issue 1:**
    *   **Description:** The frontend deployment on Netlify is consistently failing due to deep-rooted Node.js dependency conflicts, primarily related to , , , and . The backend deployment on Railway is stable and successful.
    *   **Attempted fixes:** A long series of fixes were attempted: switching to Vite and back, using yarn install v1.22.22

Done in 0.08s., creating  and  config files, forcing specific Node.js versions (18.x, 20.x), and using  and . The last fix involved aligning multiple dependency versions in  and setting a specific build command in . The user's last feedback indicated this was still failing.
    *   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Ask the user to Clear cache and redeploy on Netlify to ensure the very latest fixes are being used.
        2.  Carefully analyze the latest build log from Netlify. The previous error was an  conflict with .
        3.  If it still fails, check the  for any version mismatches between , , , and . Consider updating  and its  peer dependency to a known stable combination.
        4.  Verify the  file has the correct build command: .
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is the final and most critical step. Resolving this will make the user's website live and complete the project.
    *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    *   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (Deployment)
    *   **Blocked on other issue:** None. This is the main blocker.

*   **Issue 2:**
    *   **Description:** The user reported that the Upcoming Events section is not visible on mobile devices. This is likely a responsive design flaw in the Tailwind CSS classes.
    *   **Attempted fixes:** None.
    *   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Inspect .
        2.  Look for any responsive utility classes like  or similar that would hide the component on small screens.
        3.  Adjust the classes to ensure visibility across all breakpoints.
        4.  Use the screenshot tool with a mobile viewport to verify the fix.
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To ensure a key marketing section of the website is accessible to all users on any device.
    *   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    *   **Is recurring issue?** N
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    *   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
*   **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS,  with  for path aliasing.
*   **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, Pymongo.
*   **Database:** MongoDB Atlas.
*   **Deployment:** Backend on Railway, Frontend targeting Netlify.

**key DB schema**
*   **Collections:** , , , , , , etc., defined by Pydantic models in .

**changes in tech stack**
*   The frontend build system uses  with  to support path aliases, which is a key detail for the build process.

**All files of reference**
*   : The source of the deployment dependency issues.
*   : Configuration file for the Netlify deployment.
*   : File to inspect for the mobile view bug.
*   : Essential for the frontend build process.
*   : Contains all backend logic.
*   : Stores production credentials for MongoDB and Gmail.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
*   The frontend dependency tree in  is very fragile due to numerous patches and overrides. A clean setup might be beneficial post-deployment, but for now, the goal is to make the current setup build successfully.

**key api endpoints**
*   : Fetches all CMS content.
*   : Submits form data and triggers an email.
*   : Fetches details for a single event.
*   CRUD endpoints for all CMS content types ().

**Critical Info for New Agent**
1.  **PRIORITY #1 is DEPLOYMENT:** The user is very frustrated with deployment failures. Your primary goal is to get the frontend deployed on Netlify. The backend is already live and working.
2.  **Examine Netlify Build Logs:** Do not attempt a fix without first getting and analyzing the latest build log from the user. The errors there are the source of truth.
3.  **Mobile Bug is Secondary:** Address the Upcoming Events mobile view bug (Issue #2) after making progress on or while waiting for feedback about the deployment (Issue #1).
4.  **Credentials are Live:** The application is configured with the user's production credentials in . Handle with care. The app connects to 

**documents and test reports created in this job**
*   
*   
*   
*   Multiple test reports in  confirming application functionality prior to deployment issues.
